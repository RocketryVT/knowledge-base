# Batteries

This section contains information on batteries, including battery types, battery management systems, and battery safety.

## Battery Types

- Lithium Polymer (LiPo)
  - Lithium Polymer batteries are a type of rechargeable battery that uses a lithium-ion technology. They are commonly used in RC vehicles, drones, and other applications where a high energy density is required.
  - Advantages
    - High energy density (Wh/kg)
    - High discharge rates (Amps)
    - Lightweight
    - Low self-discharge rate
  - Disadvantages
    - Sensitive to overcharging and overdischarging
    - Can be damaged by punctures or impacts
    - Can catch fire if damaged (Temperatures in thermal runaway can result in up to 500Â°C internally)
  - Safety
    - We are no longer allowed to use LiPo batteries in our projects due to safety concerns.
- Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4)
- Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH)
