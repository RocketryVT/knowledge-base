# Filters

Filters are used to modify the data in some way. They can be used to remove noise, smooth data, or detect edges. Filters are used in many different applications, such as image processing, audio processing, and signal processing. There are many different types of filters, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some common types of filters include low-pass filters, high-pass filters, band-pass filters, and notch filters. Filters can be implemented in hardware or software, depending on the application. In this section, we will discuss some common types of filters and how they are used.
